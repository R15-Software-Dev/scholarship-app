# Documentation

This is where all of the class diagrams and other such info are stored.

They should help to plan out this project.

In order to build the diagrams, there does need to be a functional jar file for plantUML.
The current version we are using is 1.2024.7.

It is available for download [here](https://plantuml.com/download), although we've packaged it in the `docs` folder.

You will need Java installed to run the jar file.
