# Region 15 Scholarship Application 

Uses Lit, Typescript, and webpack to create a working scholarship web application for Region 15 Schools.

This code is currently only the front end code, anything on the backend should be confidential and must be
developed in-house, as it may contain personal information about the students and their parents.


# Enabled workflows

GitHub Actions allows me to build using npm/webpack and add these files to the repository.

It is also a *required* check for pull requests.
